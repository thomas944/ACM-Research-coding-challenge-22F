I used this as an opportunity to learn about working with data and various python libraries to manipulate and visualize data.
The first part is me attemping to see if there are any trends with the data by creating a chart of the how each value is correlated with one another
The second part is me grouping the car categories together and graphing the average car price
The third part is me attemping to graph the car sales for each car brand over each consecutive year in order to see which cars were more popular over each year, however I was unable to figure out how to visualize the data before the time ended.
